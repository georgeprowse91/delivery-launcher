Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Issue Log & Dependency Register rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — ISSUE AND DEPENDENCY IDENTIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Any issues already identified in previous documents\n- Dependencies identified in the WBS and Critical Path Analysis\n- External dependencies from the Critical Path Analysis\n- Schedule dependencies and constraints from the Schedule & Milestones\n- Resource dependencies from the Resource Plan\n- Regulatory or compliance dependencies from the intake summary\n- Technology or system dependencies from the intake summary\n- Stakeholder dependencies from the Engagement Charter and Governance Framework\n- Any blockers or constraints already noted across all documents\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed issue and dependency log and present the user with a structured review as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Issue and Dependency Log I want to confirm the initial issues and dependencies with you.\n\n**Proposed Issues**\n\nBased on all previous documents I have identified the following existing issues that need to be tracked from day one:\n\n| # | Issue Title | Category | Description | Impact | Priority | Owner | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nIssue Category options: Scope, Schedule, Resource, Budget, Technology, Stakeholder, Governance, Regulatory, Quality, Third Party, Other\nImpact options: Critical, High, Medium, Low\nSource options: Intake Summary, Scope Statement, Schedule, Resource Plan, Risk Register, Charter, Other\n\nPopulate with issues inferred from:\n- Open items flagged across all previous documents\n- Unconfirmed resources or rates that are blocking planning\n- Unresolved scope items or exclusion disputes\n- Schedule conflicts or milestone pressure points\n- Governance gaps such as unsigned charter or unconfirmed steering committee members\n- Regulatory deadlines that require immediate action\n- Technology readiness gaps\n\n**Proposed Dependencies**\n\nBased on all previous documents I have identified the following key dependencies that must be tracked:\n\n| # | Dependency Title | Type | Description | Dependent On | Impact if Late | Owner | Due Date |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nDependency Type options: Internal — PwC, Internal — Client, External — Third Party, External — Regulator, External — Technology, External — Market, Other\n\nPopulate with dependencies from:\n- Critical path external dependencies\n- Client actions required before PwC work can proceed\n- Third party deliverables that gate PwC workstreams\n- Technology availability or readiness dependencies\n- Regulatory approvals or decisions required\n- Data or access dependencies\n- Sign-off dependencies that gate subsequent phases\n\n**Clarification Questions**\n\n1. Are there any issues already known that I have not captured?\n2. Are there any dependencies I have missed?\n3. For any issue — has a resolution approach already been agreed?\n4. Are there any dependencies that are overdue or at immediate risk?\n5. Are there any issues that need to be escalated to the Steering Committee immediately?\n6. Are there any dependencies that are on the critical path and have no contingency?\n7. Any other issues or dependencies I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED if you are happy with the issue and dependency landscape as proposed.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed additions and corrections\n- Flag any issues requiring immediate escalation\n- Flag any dependencies on the critical path with no contingency as high priority\n- Link issues to relevant risks in the Risk Register where applicable\n- Note all assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the deliverable as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Issue and Dependency Log as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the issue and dependency management approach and summary\n2.
