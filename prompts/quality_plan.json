Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Quality Plan & Deliverable Review Schedule rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — QUALITY REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- All deliverables from the WBS Deliverable Register\n- Sign-off requirements from the RACI Matrix\n- Engagement team structure and quality roles\n- Governance review points and milestone gates from the Schedule\n- Client acceptance criteria referenced in the WBS Dictionary\n- Delivery methodology (Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid)\n- Regulatory or compliance quality requirements from the intake summary\n- Any quality standards or frameworks referenced\n\nPresent the user with a structured quality clarification as follows:\n\n'Before I build the Quality Plan I want to confirm the quality approach with you.\n\n**Proposed Quality Approach**\n\nBased on the WBS and Engagement Charter I am proposing the following quality approach for this engagement:\n\n| Quality Dimension | Proposed Approach | Standard Applied | Owner |\n|---|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate with quality dimensions including:\n- Deliverable quality (review and approval process)\n- Process quality (how work is performed)\n- Data quality (if data workstreams are in scope)\n- Technical quality (if technology workstreams are in scope)\n- Regulatory compliance quality (if regulatory obligations exist)\n- Stakeholder satisfaction quality\n\n**Proposed Deliverable Review Schedule**\n\nBased on the WBS I am proposing the following review process for each deliverable:\n\n| # | Deliverable | Phase | Review Type | Reviewer | Approver | Review Due | Approval Due |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nReview Type options: Peer Review, Internal QA Review, Client Review, Formal Sign-off, Regulatory Review, Technical Review, Joint Review\n\nPopulate with all deliverables from the WBS Deliverable Register.\n\n**Quality Clarification Questions**\n\n1. Are the proposed review types correct for each deliverable?\n2. Are there any deliverables that require a formal independent quality assurance review by someone outside the engagement team?\n3. Are there any deliverables where the client has specific acceptance criteria beyond what is in the WBS Dictionary?\n4. What is the standard review turnaround time expectation? (default: 3 business days for internal review, 5 business days for client review)\n5. What happens if a deliverable is not approved within the agreed timeframe? Is there an escalation process?\n6. Are there any deliverables that require regulatory sign-off in addition to client sign-off?\n7. Are there any quality standards or frameworks that must be applied? (e.g. ISO 9001, PwC QMS, client QMS, ITIL, specific regulatory standards)\n8. Should quality reviews be tracked formally in a quality log or is the RACI sign-off register sufficient?\n9. Are there any workstreams where quality is particularly critical and warrants additional review steps?\n10. Will there be a formal quality gate at each phase boundary before the next phase can commence?\n11. Are there any known quality risks from previous engagements with this client or in this domain?\n12. Any other quality considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to assume based on standard PwC quality management norms.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed quality approaches, standards and review requirements\n- Update review types and turnaround times as confirmed\n- Flag any deliverables with no confirmed reviewer or approver\n- Flag any phase boundaries with no quality gate\n- Note all quality assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the Quality Plan as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Quality Plan as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the full Quality Plan narrative and quality management approach\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the deliverable review schedule, quality checklist library, non-conformance log, quality metrics tracker and quality gate register applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).
