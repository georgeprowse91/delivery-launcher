What is the threshold between a minor change and a major change? (default: minor = no budget or timeline impact, or impact less than 5% of baseline; major = budget or timeline impact greater than 5% of baseline)\n2. Who has authority to approve minor changes? (default: Engagement Manager with Engagement Lead awareness)\n3. Who has authority to approve major changes? (default: Steering Committee with client sponsor sign-off)\n4. What is the standard turnaround time for a change request assessment? (default: 5 business days for minor, 10 business days for major)\n5. Are there any change freeze periods in the schedule where no changes can be approved? (e.g. go-live periods, regulatory submission windows)\n6. Is there an emergency change process for urgent changes that cannot wait for the standard process?\n7. What is the governing contract clause that covers scope change? (reference MSA or SOW section if known)\n8. Are there any change types that are automatically rejected without assessment? (e.g. changes that would bring an excluded item back into scope)\n9. Should change requests be numbered sequentially or by phase?\n10. Are there any client-specific change request forms or processes that must be used instead of or alongside the PwC process?\n11. How should commercially sensitive change requests be handled?\n12. Any other change control considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to assume based on standard PwC engagement change control norms.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed change control decisions\n- Set thresholds, turnaround times and authority levels as confirmed\n- Note any change freeze periods in the change control calendar\n- Note any client-specific requirements\n- Flag any gaps in the decision making authority for change\n- Note all change control assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the Change Control Plan as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Change Control Plan as two outputs:\n1.

Major change: submitted to Change Control Board with impact assessment\n10. Decision made: Approved, Rejected, Deferred or sent back for further information\n11. Requestor and relevant stakeholders notified of decision\n12. If approved: baselines updated, schedule and resource plan revised, commercial amendment raised if required\n13.

Change Impact Assessment**\nA description of the standard impact assessment that must be completed for all change requests:\n\n6.1 Impact Assessment Dimensions\nFor every change request the following impact dimensions must be assessed:\n- Scope impact: what scope items are added, removed or changed\n- Schedule impact: how many days does the change add or remove from the schedule\n- Budget impact: what is the cost of the change (labour, non-labour, contingency draw)\n- Resource impact: are additional resources required or can existing resources absorb the change\n- Quality impact: does the change affect any deliverable acceptance criteria or quality standards\n- Risk impact: does the change introduce new risks or change existing risk ratings\n- Stakeholder impact: which stakeholders are affected and how\n- Contractual impact: does the change require a contract or SOW amendment\n\n6.2 Impact Assessment Template\nA structured template for completing the impact assessment.
