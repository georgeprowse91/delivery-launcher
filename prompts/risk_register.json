Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Risk Register rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Risk profile from the Engagement Intake Summary (risk types and specific risks by industry group)\n- Regulatory profile and compliance obligations\n- Scope assumptions and constraints from the Scope Statement\n- Schedule risks from the Schedule & Milestones\n- Resource risks from the Resource Plan\n- Budget risks from the Budget & Cost Baseline\n- Technology and alliance partner risks from the intake summary\n- Governance and stakeholder risks from the Engagement Charter and Governance Framework\n- Any risks already identified in previous documents\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed risk register and present the user with a structured risk identification review as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Risk Register I want to confirm the risk landscape with you.\n\n**Proposed Risks**\n\nBased on all previous documents I have identified the following risks for this engagement:\n\n| # | Risk Title | Risk Category | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Initial Response | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nRisk Category options: Strategic, Financial, Operational, Schedule, Resource, Technology, Regulatory and Compliance, Stakeholder, Scope, Quality, Third Party, Cyber and Security, People, Environmental and ESG, Other\n\nLikelihood options: High, Medium, Low\nImpact options: High, Medium, Low\nInitial Response options: Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept\nSource options: Intake Summary, Scope Statement, Schedule Analysis, Resource Plan, Budget Analysis, Governance Assessment, Industry Norm, Other\n\nPopulate the table with risks identified from:\n- The risk profile in the Engagement Intake Summary\n- Schedule risks (critical path dependencies, milestone pressure, external dependencies)\n- Resource risks (unconfirmed roles, key person dependencies, skill gaps)\n- Budget risks (TBC rates, contingency adequacy, fixed price exposure)\n- Technology risks (legacy systems, integration complexity, migration risk)\n- Regulatory risks (compliance deadlines, regulatory change, enforcement risk)\n- Stakeholder risks (blockers identified in the stakeholder analysis, low sentiment, sign-off delays)\n- Scope risks (assumption failures, scope creep, out of scope requests)\n- Governance risks (decision making delays, escalation path gaps, steering committee engagement)\n\nAfter presenting the proposed risks ask the user the following:\n\n1. Are there any risks I have missed that you are aware of?\n2. Are there any risks that are not applicable to this engagement and should be removed?\n3. Do you agree with the likelihood and impact ratings? Adjust any that are incorrect.\n4. Are there any risks that have already been mitigated or accepted before the engagement has started?\n5. Are there any risks that have a known owner who should be assigned now?\n6. Are there any risks that require immediate escalation to the Steering Committee?\n7. Are there any risks that are outside PwC's control and sit with the client or a third party?\n8. Are there any commercially sensitive risks that should be flagged for restricted distribution?\n9. Any other risk considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED if you are happy with the risk landscape as proposed.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed additions, removals and rating adjustments\n- Assign risk owners where provided\n- Flag any risks requiring immediate escalation\n- Flag any risks marked as commercially sensitive for restricted distribution\n- Recalculate risk scores based on confirmed likelihood and impact ratings\n- Note all risk identification assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the Risk Register as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Risk Register as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the risk management approach, risk summary and top risk profiles\n2.
