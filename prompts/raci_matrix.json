Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful RACI Matrix rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — RACI REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- All WBS deliverables and work packages\n- All resource roles from the Resource Plan\n- All stakeholder roles from the Stakeholder Register\n- Governance roles and responsibilities from the Governance Framework\n- Decision making authority levels from the Engagement Charter\n- Sign-off requirements from the WBS Deliverable Register\n- Any RACI assignments already indicated in previous documents\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed RACI matrix and present it to the user as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full RACI Matrix I want to confirm the responsibility assignments with you.\n\n**Proposed RACI Structure**\n\nI am proposing the following roles as columns in the RACI Matrix based on the Resource Plan and Stakeholder Register:\n\n| # | Role | Name (if confirmed) | Organisation | Included in RACI |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate with all roles from the Resource Plan and key stakeholder roles from the Stakeholder Register that have decision making, approval or sign-off responsibilities.\n\n**Proposed RACI Sample**\n\nTo validate the approach I am showing a sample of the proposed RACI assignments for the first phase of the engagement:\n\n| Activity or Deliverable | [Role 1] | [Role 2] | [Role 3] | [Role 4] | [Role 5] |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate with the first 10-15 activities or deliverables and proposed RACI assignments.\n\n**RACI Clarification Questions**\n\n1. Are the proposed roles correct and complete for the RACI? Add or remove roles as needed.\n2. Are the sample RACI assignments correct? Note any that need to be changed.\n3. Are there any activities or deliverables where the accountability (A) is unclear or disputed?\n4. Are there any roles that should only appear as Informed (I) and never as Responsible (R) or Accountable (A)?\n5. Are there any activities where the client must be Accountable rather than PwC?\n6. Are there any activities where sign-off is required that are not currently marked as requiring Accountable sign-off?\n7. Are there any third party or alliance partner roles that need to be included in the RACI?\n8. Are there any governance activities (e.g. Steering Committee preparation, risk reporting) that need to be added as RACI rows?\n9. Should the RACI be at deliverable level, work package level or both?\n10. Any other RACI considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED if you are happy with the proposed structure and sample assignments.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed role changes, additions and assignment corrections\n- Remove any roles flagged as not applicable\n- Flag any activities with no Accountable (A) assigned as incomplete\n- Flag any activities with more than one Accountable (A) as a conflict\n- Flag any roles with no assignments as potentially redundant\n- Note all RACI assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the RACI Matrix as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the RACI Matrix as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the RACI narrative, accountability summary and key RACI decisions\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the full RACI matrix, accountability summary, role responsibility profile, RACI validation checks and governance RACI applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).

RACI Matrix — full matrix with frozen columns and rotated headers, kept as is. Apply one A per row validation.\n2. Accountability & Sign-off Register — merge the Accountability Summary and Sign-off Register; accountability table at top, sign-off register below with a clear section header row.\n3. RACI Validation Log — validation check results; fold role responsibility profiles into the Accountability sheet rather than a separate tab.\n4.

activities from the Governance Framework\n- Add rows for all key decision points identified in the Engagement Charter\n- Assign RACI values based on:\n  - WBS ownership (PwC owned = PwC R and A, Client owned = Client A with PwC R or C)\n  - Sign-off requirements from the Deliverable Register\n  - Decision making authority from the Engagement Charter\n  - Governance responsibilities from the Governance Framework\n- Ensure every row has exactly one A\n- Ensure every row has at least one R\n\nFor Sheet 2 Accountability Summary:\n- Calculate all counts from Sheet 1 using COUNTIF formulas\n- Run validation checks and populate Validation Status for every row\n\nFor Sheet 3 Role Responsibility Profile:\n- Calculate all counts from Sheet 1 using COUNTIF formulas per role\n- Flag any roles with zero assignments for review\n\nFor Sheet 4 Governance RACI:\n- Pre-populate all governance activity rows\n- Assign RACI values based on standard PwC engagement governance norms\n- Ensure consistency with the Governance Framework RACI from P1.6\n\nFor Sheet 5 RACI Validation Log:\n- Pre-populate with all validation issues identified during automated checks\n- Set Status to Open for all

Flag any row where COUNTIF of A values > 1 as a Multiple A conflict\n2. Flag any row where COUNTIF of A values = 0 as a Missing A gap\n3. Flag any row where COUNTIF of R values = 0 as a Missing R gap\n4. Flag any column where the total of R + A = 0 as a Zero Assignment role\n5. Flag any client-owned deliverable where the A is assigned to a PwC role as a potential accountability conflict\n\nAll flagged issues must be automatically written to Sheet 5 RACI Validation Log.\n\n---\n\nWhere a field cannot be determined leave the cell blank and add a comment: 'To be confirmed.'\n\nEnsure all dropdown validations are applied and functional.\n\nEnsure all formulas are applied to all data rows and will extend correctly when new rows are added.\n\nEnsure column headers on Sheet 1 are rotated 45 degrees for readability.\n\nEnsure Sheet 1 is protected to prevent accidental deletion of role columns with unlocked cells for RACI value entry only.\n\nEnsure the Governance RACI on Sheet 4 is consistent with the Governance RACI produced in the Governance Framework (P1.6).\n\nOnce both files are generated and available for download confirm you are ready to proceed to Step P2.6 Budget & Cost Baseline."
