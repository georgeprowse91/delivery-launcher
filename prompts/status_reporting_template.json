Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Status Report Template rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — STATUS REPORTING REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Reporting requirements from the Engagement Charter and Governance Framework\n- Governance meeting cadence and reporting audiences\n- Stakeholder communication preferences from the Communications Plan\n- Milestone and schedule structure from the Schedule\n- Key metrics and KPIs from the Objectives and Success Criteria\n- Risk and issue reporting requirements\n- Financial reporting requirements from the charter commercial terms\n- Delivery methodology (Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid)\n\nPresent the user with a structured reporting clarification as follows:\n\n'Before I build the Status Reporting Template I want to confirm the reporting requirements with you.\n\n**Proposed Report Types**\n\nBased on the Governance Framework and Communications Plan I am proposing the following status reports:\n\n| # | Report Name | Audience | Frequency | Format | Owner | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate with report types inferred from the governance and communications documents including:\n- Weekly Status Report (engagement team and client project owner)\n- Fortnightly Steering Committee Pack\n- Monthly Programme Dashboard\n- Sprint Review Report (if Agile or Hybrid)\n- Risk and Issues Summary\n- Financial Status Report\n- Milestone Completion Report\n- Engagement Close-out Report\n\n**Reporting Clarification Questions**\n\n1. Are the proposed report types correct and complete?\n2. For the Weekly Status Report — what sections are most important to the client?\n3. Should the financial section show actuals only or actuals versus budget?\n4. Should the risk section show all risks or only Critical and High?\n5. Should the report include a RAG (Red Amber Green) status for each workstream?\n6. Are there any metrics or KPIs that must appear in every status report?\n7. Should the Steering Committee Pack be a separate document or an extended version of the Weekly Status Report?\n8. Are there any report sections that are for internal PwC use only and should not be shared with the client?\n9. Is there a maximum page length for any of the reports?\n10. Should reports be distributed as Word documents, PowerPoint presentations or Excel dashboards?\n11. Are there any existing client report templates or branding standards I should align to?\n12. Who reviews and approves the status report before it is distributed?\n13. Any other reporting requirements I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to assume based on standard PwC engagement reporting norms.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed reporting requirements and preferences\n- Note any sections flagged as internal PwC use only\n- Note any page length constraints\n- Note any existing client templates to align to\n- Confirm the RAG status approach\n- Confirm the financial reporting approach\n\nThen proceed to build the Status Reporting Template as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Status Reporting Template as three outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards — the Weekly Status Report template\n2. A formatted PowerPoint presentation (.pptx) applying PwC formatting standards — the Steering Committee Pack template\n3. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) applying PwC formatting standards — the Programme Dashboard template\n\nMake all three files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).
