Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below \u2014 do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"\u26a0\ufe0f Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Objectives & Benefits Baseline rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 \u2014 OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse the Engagement Intake Summary and Scope Statement and extract all objectives-related information including:\n- Objective types and themes from the engagement brief\n- Specific objectives provided\n- Additional context provided per objective type\n- Success criteria and desired outcomes from the brief\n- Scope boundaries that constrain or shape the objectives\n- Regulatory and risk profile that may drive additional objectives\n\nBased on this information present the user with a structured objectives review as follows:\n\n**Proposed Engagement Objectives**\n\n| # | Objective | Objective Type | Theme | Priority | Source | Confidence | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nObjective Type options: Business Problem, Strategic Objective, Regulatory & Compliance Driver, Technology Driver, People & Organisational Driver\nPriority options: Critical, High, Medium, Low\nSource options: Provided in brief, Inferred from scope, Inferred from industry, Inferred from regulatory profile, Recommended \u2014 confirm with client\nConfidence options: High, Medium, Low\n\n**Proposed Success Criteria**\n\n| # | Success Criterion | Linked Objective # | Measurement Approach | Target | Measurement Frequency | Owner | Source | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nMeasurement Frequency options: At completion, Monthly, Quarterly, At each milestone, Ongoing\n\n**Proposed Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| # | KPI | Linked Objective # | KPI Type | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency | Data Source | Owner | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nKPI Type options: Financial, Operational, Technology, People, Customer, Compliance, Quality\n\n**Proposed Benefits**\n\n| # | Benefit | Linked Objective # | Benefit Type | Quantified | Estimated Value | Realisation Timeframe | Owner | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nBenefit Type options: Financial, Operational, Strategic, Risk Reduction, Compliance, Customer, People\nQuantified options: Yes, No, Partially\n\nAfter presenting the tables ask the user the following:\n\n'Above is my proposed objectives, success criteria, KPIs and benefits based on the Engagement Intake Summary and Scope Statement. Please review and:\n\n1. Confirm any items you are happy with\n2. Correct any items that are inaccurate or not relevant\n3. Add any objectives, success criteria, KPIs or benefits I have missed\n4. Adjust priorities where needed\n5. Provide any quantitative targets or baseline data you have available for KPIs and benefits\n6. Identify who owns each objective and success criterion where known\n7. Type PROCEED if you are happy to continue with the objectives as proposed\n\nThe more detail you provide here the more useful your Objectives & Benefits Baseline will be as a management tool throughout the engagement.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 \u2014 CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed, corrected or additional items\n- Remove any items flagged as not applicable\n- Update priorities, targets, owners and baselines as provided\n- Flag any objectives where no success criterion or KPI has been identified as incomplete\n- Flag any benefits that have not been quantified as unconfirmed\n- Note any contradictions between the objectives and the scope statement\n\nThen proceed to build the deliverable as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 \u2014 BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate an Objectives & Benefits Baseline deliverable as two outputs:\n1.
