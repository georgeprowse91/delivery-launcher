Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Communications Matrix rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — COMMUNICATIONS REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- All stakeholders from the Stakeholder Register including influence, interest and engagement strategy\n- Governance bodies and meeting cadence from the Governance Framework\n- Reporting requirements referenced in the Engagement Charter\n- Engagement team structure and key roles\n- Delivery methodology and workstream structure\n- Regulatory or compliance communication obligations\n- Any communication preferences noted in the stakeholder analysis\n- Any communication constraints or sensitivities noted\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed communications plan and present the user with a structured review as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Communications Plan I want to confirm the communications approach with you.\n\n**Proposed Communications Audiences**\n\nBased on the Stakeholder Register and Governance Framework I am proposing the following communication audiences:\n\n| # | Audience | Stakeholder Type | Engagement Strategy | Key Communication Needs | Preferred Channel | Sensitivity |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate with all stakeholder groups from the register grouped by engagement strategy (Manage Closely, Keep Satisfied, Keep Informed, Monitor).\n\n**Proposed Communications Activities**\n\nI am proposing the following recurring communications activities:\n\n| # | Communication | Type | Audience | Frequency | Channel | Owner | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nType options: Report, Meeting, Workshop, Briefing, Newsletter, Dashboard, Announcement, Escalation, Ad Hoc\nChannel options: Email, MS Teams, SharePoint, In-person Meeting, Video Call, Steering Committee, Printed Report, Other\n\nPopulate with communications activities inferred from:\n- Governance meeting cadence (Steering Committee, Working Groups, etc.)\n- Reporting requirements from the charter (weekly status report, monthly dashboard)\n- Stakeholder engagement strategies from the stakeholder analysis\n- Standard PwC engagement communications norms\n- Regulatory or compliance reporting obligations\n\n**Communications Clarification Questions**\n\n1. Are there any communication audiences I have missed?\n2. Are there any communications activities that should be added or removed?\n3. Are there any stakeholders who have specific communication preferences I should know about?\n4. Are there any communications that are politically sensitive and require careful handling?\n5. Are there any communications that must be approved by a specific person before distribution?\n6. Are there any communications blackout periods (e.g. board reporting periods, regulatory quiet periods, client change freezes)?\n7. Are there any branding or template requirements for client-facing communications?\n8. Is there a preferred collaboration platform for day-to-day team communications?\n9.

Who is the primary communications owner on the client side?\n12. Are there any media or external communications considerations?\n13. Any other communications considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to infer from the available information.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed audiences, activities and communication preferences\n- Flag any politically sensitive communications for special handling notes\n- Flag any communications requiring pre-approval\n- Note all communications assumptions made\n- Identify any gaps where a stakeholder group has no planned communications\n\nThen proceed to build the Communications Plan as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Communications Plan as two outputs:\n1.
