Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not containing a placeholder like [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, output the following warning and stop — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields are filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Governance Framework rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — GOVERNANCE REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all three input documents and extract the following:\n- Engagement team structure and key roles\n- Governance bodies referenced in the Engagement Charter\n- Stakeholder influence and interest levels\n- Engagement objectives, scope and complexity\n- Delivery methodology and workstreams\n- Reporting requirements referenced in the charter\n- Decision making authority levels\n- Escalation paths\n- Regulatory and compliance obligations\n- Any governance-related open items from the charter\n\nBased on this information present the user with a structured governance clarification as follows:\n\n'Before I build the Governance Framework I need to confirm a few governance design decisions. Please review the proposed structure below and provide your input.\n\n**Proposed Governance Structure**\n\nBased on the Engagement Charter and Stakeholder Analysis I am proposing the following governance layers for this engagement:\n\n| Layer | Governance Body | Purpose | Proposed Chair | Proposed Members | Proposed Frequency |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate this table with appropriate governance bodies inferred from the engagement complexity, stakeholder map and charter. Include as relevant:\n- Steering Committee\n- Programme Board (if complexity warrants it)\n- Working Group(s) by workstream\n- Risk and Issues Forum\n- Change Control Board\n- Technical Design Authority (if technology workstreams are present)\n- Quality Review Board (if quality governance is required)\n\n**Governance Design Questions**\n\n1. Do you want to add, remove or modify any of the proposed governance bodies?\n2. Are there any existing client governance bodies this engagement needs to connect into or report to?\n3. Who has final decision making authority for scope changes?\n4. Who has final decision making authority for budget changes?\n5. Who has final decision making authority for resource changes?\n6. What is the escalation path if a risk or issue cannot be resolved at the working level?\n7. Will the Steering Committee have a formal Terms of Reference document?\n8. Are there any governance constraints imposed by the client organisation (e.g. existing committee structures, approval thresholds, delegated authority limits)?\n9. What is the quorum requirement for the Steering Committee to be able to make binding decisions?\n10. How will governance meeting minutes and actions be managed and distributed?\n11. Will there be a dedicated Risk and Issues owner separate from the Engagement Manager?\n12. Any other governance considerations you would like reflected in the framework?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to infer from the available information or leave as To be confirmed.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed governance design decisions\n- For any item where the user typed PROCEED or left blank infer the most appropriate governance design based on engagement complexity and industry norms\n- Note any inferred decisions as assumptions in the framework\n- Cross-reference against the charter and flag any contradictions\n\nThen proceed to build the Governance Framework as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK\n\nGenerate the Governance Framework as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the full Governance Framework narrative and structure\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the meeting cadence planner, decision and action log, governance RACI and terms of reference, and change log applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).
