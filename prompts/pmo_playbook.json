The deliverable is an PMO Playbook — a PowerPoint presentation that serves as the primary operational reference for the engagement team and a communication tool for client stakeholders. It consolidates all planning outputs into a single visually compelling document that the team will use throughout delivery.\n\nBefore building the PMO Playbook, you must first work through a structured consolidation review with the user. Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful PMO Playbook rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — CONSOLIDATION REVIEW\n\nCROSS-DOCUMENT CONSISTENCY AUDIT\n\nBefore building the PMO Playbook, run the following checks across all provided planning documents. Flag each as PASS / FAIL / WARNING with a brief finding.\n\n**Scope Consistency**\n- Do the WBS Level 2 workstreams (P2.1) match the workstreams in the Scope Statement (P1.3) and Engagement Charter (P1.5)?\n- Are all scope inclusions from P1.3 represented by at least one WBS element?\n- Are all scope exclusions from P1.3 absent from the WBS?\n\n**Date Consistency**\n- Does the engagement start date in the Schedule (P2.2) match the Charter start date (P1.5)?\n- Does the engagement end date in the Schedule (P2.2) match the Charter end date (P1.5)?\n- Do Resource Plan start/end dates (P2.4) fall within Schedule dates (P2.2)?\n- Are major milestone dates consistent between Schedule (P2.2) and Critical Path (P2.3)?\n\n**Resource and Budget Consistency**\n- Do all roles in the RACI Matrix (P2.5) correspond to roles in the Resource Plan (P2.4)?\n- Does total effort in the Resource Plan (P2.4) align with the effort used to build the Budget (P2.6) within a 5% tolerance?\n- Do Budget monthly cost peaks (P2.6) align with Resource loading peaks (P2.4) by month?\n\n**Governance Consistency**\n- Are all governance bodies from the Governance Framework (P1.6) referenced in the Communications Plan (P2.9)?\n- Do escalation paths in the Risk Register (P2.7) and Issue Log (P2.8) reference governance bodies that exist in P1.6?\n- Does the Change Control Plan (P2.12) authority matrix reference decision makers who appear in the RACI (P2.5) and Governance Framework (P1.6)?\n\n**Open Items Consolidation**\n- Consolidate all open items from all 17 planning documents into the Master Open Items sheet.\n- Flag any item marked \"Blocks Delivery Start\".\n- Flag any item raised in a P1.x step but never resolved in a later step.\n\nReport all FAIL and WARNING findings in a table in the Word document:\nDocument(s) | Inconsistency Found | Recommended Resolution | Blocks Delivery Start (Y/N)\n\nIf there are more than 5 FAIL findings, prepend the following banner to the playbook cover slide:\n\"⚠️ Significant planning inconsistencies detected. Resolve all FAIL items before distributing this playbook. Known conflicts are in the Consistency Audit section.\"\n\n---\n\n\nParse all input documents and perform the following consolidation checks:\n\n1. Completeness check — verify that all 17 previous planning outputs have been provided. List any that are missing or incomplete.\n\n2. Consistency check — identify any inconsistencies across the documents:\n- Scope inconsistencies\n- Date and milestone inconsistencies\n- Resource and role inconsistencies\n- Budget inconsistencies\n- RACI inconsistencies\n- Risk inconsistencies\n\n3. Open items consolidation — compile a master list of all open items flagged across all planning documents.\n\n4. Readiness assessment — assess whether the engagement is ready to move from planning to delivery.\n\nPresent the findings to the user as follows:\n\n'I have reviewed all planning documents provided. Here is my consolidation assessment before I build the PMO Playbook.\n\n**Completeness Check**\n\n| Document | Status | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n\nPopulate with all 17 planning documents and their completeness status.\n\n**Consistency Issues Found**\n\n| # | Issue | Documents Affected | Recommended Resolution |\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n**Master Open Items List**\n\n| # | Open Item | Source Document | Priority | Action Required | Owner |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n**Engagement Readiness Assessment**\n\nOverall Readiness: [Ready to Proceed / Proceed with Conditions / Not Ready]\n\nReadiness by dimension:\n- Scope | Schedule | Resources | Budget | Governance | Risk | Quality | Stakeholders | Communications | Change Control\n\nAfter presenting the assessment ask the user:\n\n1. Are you aware of the consistency issues identified? How would you like them resolved?\n2. Are there any open items that have been resolved since the planning documents were completed?\n3. Any additional context or decisions made since planning was completed that I should incorporate?\n4. Are you satisfied with the engagement readiness assessment?\n5. Are there any sections of the playbook you want to emphasise or expand?\n6. Are there any sections that should be omitted or treated as internal PwC only?\n7. Type PROCEED when you are ready for me to build the PMO Playbook.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed resolutions to consistency issues\n- Update open items with any confirmed resolutions\n- Note any additional context provided\n- Note any sections to be omitted\n\nThen proceed to build the PMO Playbook as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the PMO Playbook as two outputs:\n1. A formatted PowerPoint presentation (.pptx) applying PwC formatting standards — the PMO Playbook\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) applying PwC formatting standards — the PMP Master Tracker\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR POWERPOINT\n\nSlide dimensions: Widescreen 16:9\n\nColour Palette\n- Slide background: #FFFFFF\n- Title and divider slides: #D04A02 background, white text\n- Section divider slides: #F5F5F5 background, #D04A02 heading\n- Content slides: white background\n- Accent colour 1: #D04A02\n- Accent colour 2: #2D2D2D\n- Accent colour 3: #F5F5F5\n- Accent colour 4: #AAAAAA\n- Chart and visual colours: #D04A02, #F57F17, #22C55E, #3B82F6, #AAAAAA, #E2231A\n\nTypography\n- Title font: Helvetica Neue Bold, 28pt, white on title slides, #2D2D2D on content slides\n- Subtitle font: Helvetica Neue, 18pt\n- Section label font: Helvetica Neue, 11pt, #D04A02, uppercase\n- Body font: Helvetica Neue, 11pt, #2D2D2D\n- Table body font: Helvetica Neue, 10pt\n- Caption and label font: Helvetica Neue, 9pt, #AAAAAA\n- Footer font: Helvetica Neue, 8pt, #AAAAAA\n\nSlide Layout\n- PwC logo placeholder top left on all slides\n- Slide number bottom right on all slides\n- Confidentiality notice bottom centre on all slides: 'PwC Private and Confidential'\n- Thin orange rule (#D04A02, 2pt) at top of each content slide immediately below the logo\n- Section label top right of content slides in #D04A02 uppercase\n- Maximum 5 bullet points per slide\n- Maximum 6 rows per table on a single slide — use two slides if more rows are needed\n\nTable Formatting on Slides\n- Header row: #D04A02 background, white text, bold, 10pt\n- Alternating rows: white and #F5F5F5\n- Borders: 0.5pt #DDDDDD\n\nRAG Indicators on Slides\n- Use filled circles (●) for RAG status\n- Red ●: #C62828\n- Amber ●: #F57F17\n- Green ●: #2E7D32\n- Blue ●: #3B82F6\n- Grey ●: #AAAAAA\n\nProcess Flow Slides\n- Use simple left-to-right arrow flows\n- Step boxes: #FFF4F0 background, #D04A02 border, #2D2D2D text\n- Arrow colour: #D04A02\n- Decision diamonds: #FFF8E1 background, #F57F17 border\n\nWORKBOOK RATIONALISATION — generate a maximum of 5 sheets:\n1.
