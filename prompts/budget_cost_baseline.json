Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Budget Baseline & Cost Tracker rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — BUDGET REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Commercial terms from the Engagement Charter (fee structure, estimated budget, billing frequency)\n- Resource roles, effort estimates and daily rates from the Resource Plan\n- WBS phases, workstreams and deliverables\n- Engagement timeline and milestone dates from the Schedule\n- Any cost-related assumptions or constraints already noted\n- Alliance partner or third party costs referenced\n- Travel, expense or other non-labour costs referenced\n- Contingency assumptions referenced\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed budget structure and present it to the user as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Budget and Cost Baseline I need to confirm a number of cost inputs with you. Please review the proposed structure and provide your input.\n\n**Proposed Budget Structure**\n\nBased on the Resource Plan and Engagement Charter I am proposing the following budget structure:\n\n| # | Cost Category | Sub-category | Estimated Amount | Basis of Estimate | Confidence | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nCost categories to include:\n- Labour — PwC (by seniority level)\n- Labour — Client (if client time is being tracked)\n- Labour — Alliance Partner\n- Labour — Third Party\n- Travel and Accommodation\n- Technology and Software Licences\n- Training and Enablement\n- Printing and Production\n- Contingency\n- Other Direct Costs\n\nBasis of Estimate options: Confirmed rate x effort, Estimated rate x effort, Fixed price, Allowance, Historical benchmark, TBC\n\n**Budget Clarification Questions**\n\n0. **Fee Structure Confirmation (resolve before all other questions)**\nThe Engagement Context above indicates the fee structure is [Fee Structure from context block]. Confirm which financial model applies before proceeding, as it changes the entire structure of this deliverable:\n\n- **Time and Materials (T&M)**: Cost baseline = effort × daily rate per role. Budget tracks actual cost vs approved budget. Over-spend is billable if within scope.\n- **Fixed Price**: A fixed fee is agreed regardless of actual effort. The baseline tracks cost-to-complete against the fixed envelope — margin erosion is the key risk. Invoicing follows agreed milestones, not time consumed.\n- **Capped T&M**: Time and materials up to an agreed maximum cap. The baseline tracks both rate × effort and proximity to the cap.\n\nPlease confirm: which fee structure applies? If Fixed Price or Capped T&M, provide the agreed fee amount and the invoicing milestone schedule.\n\n1. Are the daily rates for each PwC seniority level confirmed? If not please provide them or confirm they are To be confirmed.\n2. Are there any fixed price components of this engagement? If so what are they and what is the fixed price?\n3. What is the agreed contingency percentage or amount? (default assumption: 10% of total labour cost)\n4. Are there any not-to-exceed (NTE) caps on any cost categories?\n5. Are there any client-provided resources or assets that offset costs (e.g. client provides office space, technology or licences)?\n6. Are travel and expenses reimbursable by the client or absorbed by PwC?\n7. Are there any milestone-based payment triggers? If so what are the milestones and payment amounts?\n8. Is there a purchase order number or approved budget reference I should include?\n9. Are there any foreign currency costs that need to be tracked separately?\n10. Is there a separate budget for change requests or is change managed within the contingency?\n11. What is the billing currency?\n12. Are there any cost reporting requirements beyond standard monthly financial reporting?\n13. Any other budget considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to assume based on standard engagement financial management norms.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed rates, amounts, caps and payment structures\n- Apply confirmed contingency percentage\n- Flag any cost categories where rates or amounts are still TBC\n- Calculate total estimated budget from confirmed inputs\n- Flag any budget components that appear inconsistent with the charter budget\n- Note all budget assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the Budget and Cost Baseline as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nFEE STRUCTURE ADAPTATION\n\nApply the following model before generating any Excel sheets:\n\n**If Time and Materials:**\n- Cost baseline: Effort Hours × Daily Rate per Role per Workstream per Month.\n- Track: Planned Cost | Actual Cost | Forecast to Complete | Variance.\n- Include EVM metrics: SPI, CPI, EAC, VAC, TCPI.\n\n**If Fixed Price:**\n- Replace the T&M cost build with a Fixed Price Cost Control model:\n  - Fixed Fee: [confirmed amount]\n  - Estimated Internal Cost to Deliver: effort × internal rates from Resource Plan\n  - Gross Margin: Fixed Fee minus Internal Cost\n  - Cost to Complete (CTC): remaining estimated cost\n  - Earned Value: % of deliverables signed off × Fixed Fee\n  - Margin at Risk: CTC vs remaining Fixed Fee\n- Replace the Invoice Schedule sheet with a Milestone Invoicing Schedule: Milestone | Invoiceable Amount | Invoice Date | Status.\n- Add a Margin Tracker table to the Financial Dashboard & EVM sheet: Month | Planned Cost | Actual Cost | Fixed Fee Earned | Margin £ | Margin %.\n\n**If Capped T&M:**\n- Build as T&M above and add:\n  - Cap Amount column (the agreed NTE cap per period or total).\n  - Cap Utilisation % = (Actual + Forecast to Complete) ÷ Cap Amount.\n  - Colour warning: orange when Cap Utilisation > 80%, red when > 95%.\n\n---\n\n\nGenerate the Budget and Cost Baseline as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the budget narrative, cost baseline summary and financial management approach\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the full budget baseline, cost tracker, invoice schedule, financial dashboard, earned value analysis and cost change log applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).
