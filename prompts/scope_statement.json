Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Scope Statement & Exclusions Log rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — SCOPE REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse the Engagement Intake Summary and extract all scope-related information including:\n- In scope items provided\n- Out of scope items provided\n- Success criteria and desired outcomes\n- Engagement objectives and themes\n- Service offerings and building blocks selected\n- Technology and alliance partners involved\n- Regulatory and risk profile\n\nBased on this information present the user with a structured scope review table as follows:\n\n**Proposed In Scope**\n\n| # | Scope Item | Category | Source | Confidence | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nCategory options: Process, Technology, Data, People & Organisation, Regulatory & Compliance, Reporting & Analytics, Integration, Other\nSource options: Provided in brief, Inferred from objectives, Inferred from services, Inferred from industry, Recommended — confirm with client\nConfidence options: High, Medium, Low\n\n**Proposed Out of Scope**\n\n| # | Exclusion Item | Category | Source | Reason for Exclusion | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n**Proposed Assumptions**\n\n| # | Assumption | Category | Impact if Wrong | Confidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n**Proposed Constraints**\n\n| # | Constraint | Category | Impact | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nAfter presenting the tables ask the user the following:\n\n'Above is my proposed scope, exclusions, assumptions and constraints based on the Engagement Intake Summary. Please review and:\n\n1. Confirm any items you are happy with\n2. Correct any items that are inaccurate\n3. Add any items I have missed\n4. Remove any items that do not apply\n5. Clarify the confidence level on any items marked as Low or where the source is Recommended — confirm with client\n6. Type PROCEED if you are happy to continue with the scope as proposed\n\nThe more detail you provide here the more accurate your Scope Statement will be. Any items left as unconfirmed will be flagged as assumptions in the final document.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed, corrected or additional items\n- Remove any items flagged as not applicable\n- Flag any items still marked as Low confidence or unconfirmed as open assumptions\n- Note any scope items where the user has provided clarification that contradicts the original brief\n\nThen proceed to build the deliverable as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate a Scope Statement and Exclusions Log as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards\n2.

Scope Register — inclusions, exclusions, and assumptions in one table with a clear \"Type\" column (Inclusion / Exclusion / Assumption / Constraint).\n2. Scope Change Log — tracks scope changes against the agreed baseline; add a \"Status\" column (Pending / Approved / Rejected) and use filtering rather than a separate archive.\n3. Scope RACI — ownership of scope elements by workstream.\n4. Change Log.\nDo not generate separate assumption register or archive sheets.\n\nEXCEL WORKBOOK STRUCTURE\n\n**Sheet 1: Exclusions Log**\n\nSummary bar (rows 1-2):\n- Total Exclusions: =COUNTA(B4:B1000)\n- Confirmed Exclusions: =COUNTIF(F4:F1000,\"Confirmed\")\n- Open Exclusions: =COUNTIF(F4:F1000,\"Open\")\n- Disputed Exclusions: =COUNTIF(F4:F1000,\"Disputed\")\n\nColumns:\n- Exclusion ID (=\"EXC-\"&TEXT(ROW()-3,\"000\"))\n- Exclusion Item\n- Category (dropdown: Process, Technology, Data, People & Organisation, Regulatory & Compliance, Reporting & Analytics, Integration, Other)\n- Description\n- Reason for Exclusion\n- Status (dropdown: Open, Confirmed, Disputed, Deferred to Future Phase)\n- Raised By\n- Date Raised\n- Confirmed By\n- Date Confirmed\n- Notes\n\nConditional formatting:\n- Status Confirmed: #E8F5E9, text #2E7D32\n- Status Disputed: #FFEBEE, text #C62828\n- Status Open: #FFF8E1, text #F57F17\n- Status Deferred: #EFF6FF, text #3B82F6\n\n**Sheet 2: Assumptions Register**\n\nSummary bar (rows 1-2):\n- Total Assumptions: =COUNTA(B4:B1000)\n- Open Assumptions: =COUNTIF(G4:G1000,\"Open\")\n- Low Confidence: =COUNTIF(F4:F1000,\"Low\")\n- Invalidated: =COUNTIF(G4:G1000,\"Invalidated\")\n\nColumns:\n- Assumption ID (=\"ASM-\"&TEXT(ROW()-3,\"000\"))\n- Assumption\n- Category (dropdown: Scope, Resource, Technology, Timeline, Budget, Regulatory, Stakeholder, Other)\n- Impact if Wrong (dropdown: Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n- Confidence Level (dropdown: High, Medium, Low)\n- Made By\n- Status (dropdown: Open, Confirmed, Invalidated)\n- Date Raised\n- Date Confirmed or Invalidated\n- Action Required if Invalidated\n- Owner\n- Notes\n\nConditional formatting:\n- Impact Critical and Confidence Low: #FFEBEE, text #C62828, bold\n- Status Invalidated: #FFEBEE, text #C62828\n- Status Confirmed: #E8F5E9, text #2E7D32\n- Confidence Low: #FFF8E1, text #F57F17\n\n**Sheet 3: Constraints Register**\n\nSummary bar (rows 1-2):\n- Total Constraints: =COUNTA(B4:B1000)\n- High Impact Constraints: =COUNTIF(E4:E1000,\"High\")\n- Open Constraints: =COUNTIF(G4:G1000,\"Open\")\n\nColumns:\n- Constraint ID (=\"CON-\"&TEXT(ROW()-3,\"000\"))\n- Constraint\n- Category (dropdown: Time, Budget, Resource, Technology, Regulatory, Organisational, Other)\n- Description\n- Impact (dropdown: Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n- Source\n- Status (dropdown: Open, Accepted, Mitigated, Closed)\n- Mitigation or Response\n- Owner\n- Date Raised\n- Notes\n\nConditional formatting:\n- Impact Critical: #FFEBEE, text #C62828, bold\n- Impact High: #FFF3E0, text #E65100\n- Status Mitigated: #E8F5E9, text #2E7D32\n- Status Open and Impact Critical or High: #FFEBEE, text #C62828\n\n**Sheet 4: Scope Change Log**\n\nColumns:\n- Change ID (=\"SCH-\"&TEXT(ROW()-3,\"000\"))\n- Date Raised\n- Description of Proposed Change\n- Requested By\n- Category (dropdown: In Scope Addition, Exclusion Removal, Assumption Change, Constraint Change, Other)\n- Impact Assessment\n- Decision (dropdown: Approved, Rejected, Deferred, Under Review)\n- Decision Date\n- Decision Made By\n- Notes\n\n**Sheet 5: Reference — Categories and Definitions**\n\nA read-only reference sheet defining all category values and dropdown options used across the workbook.\n\n---\n\nDATA POPULATION\n\nPopulate all sheets with the confirmed and inferred scope items from Steps 1 and 2.\n\nFor each assumption:\n- Set Confidence Level based on the source (Provided in brief = High, Inferred = Medium, Recommended = Low)\n- Set Status to Open for all pre-populated rows\n- Populate Action Required if Invalidated with a suggested contingency\n\nFor each constraint:\n- Infer constraints from the engagement timeline, regulatory profile, technology landscape and organisational context\n- Set Status to Open for all pre-populated rows\n\nFor the Exclusions Log:\n- Set Status to Confirmed for items explicitly stated as out of scope in the brief\n- Set Status to Open for items inferred as out of scope\n\n---\n\nWhere a field cannot be determined leave the cell blank and add a comment: 'To be confirmed.'\n\nEnsure all dropdown validations are applied and functional.\n\nEnsure all formulas are applied to all data rows and will extend correctly when new rows are added.\n\nOnce both files are generated and available for download confirm you are ready to proceed to Step P1.4 Objectives & Success Criteria."
