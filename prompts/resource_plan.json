Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nCONTEXT CHECK\n\nBefore presenting any clarification questions to the user, count how many of the 16 Engagement Context fields above are populated (i.e. not blank and not still containing a placeholder such as [CLIENT_NAME]).\n\nIf fewer than 8 of the 16 fields are completed, stop and output the message below — do not proceed to Step 1 until the user confirms the fields have been filled:\n\n\"⚠️ Insufficient engagement context detected. Only [N] of 16 required context fields are populated. To generate a meaningful Resource Loading Table rather than a generic template, please fill in at minimum: Client Name, Engagement Name, Delivery Methodology, Fee Structure, Engagement Start Date, Total Budget, and Primary Workstreams. Update the context block above and re-run.\"\n\nIf 8 or more fields are populated, proceed to Step 1 below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — RESOURCE REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Engagement team roles identified in the charter and governance framework\n- WBS work packages and their ownership (PwC, Client, Joint, Third Party)\n- Effort estimates per WBS element from the WBS\n- Task durations and dates from the schedule\n- Critical path tasks requiring priority resourcing\n- Delivery methodology and sprint structure if Agile or Hybrid\n- Alliance partners and third party vendors involved\n- Any resource constraints or assumptions already noted\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed resource plan and present it to the user as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Resource Plan I want to confirm the resource requirements with you.\n\n**Proposed Resource Roles**\n\nBased on the WBS, Schedule and Engagement Charter I am proposing the following resource roles for this engagement:\n\n| # | Role | Organisation | Seniority | Estimated Effort (days) | Estimated FTE | Primary Workstream(s) | Start Date | End Date |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nSeniority options: Partner, Director, Senior Manager, Manager, Senior Associate, Associate, Analyst, Specialist, Other\nOrganisation options: PwC, Client, Alliance Partner, Third Party\n\nPopulate this table with all roles inferred from:\n- Engagement team listed in the charter\n- Workstream leads and team members required for each WBS phase\n- Governance roles (Steering Committee support, risk owner, change manager)\n- Technical roles required for technology workstreams\n- Subject matter expert roles required for regulatory, risk or industry-specific workstreams\n- Client-side roles required to support each workstream\n\n**Resource Clarification Questions**\n\n1. Are the proposed roles correct and complete? Add, remove or modify as needed.\n2. Do you have named individuals for any of these roles? If so please provide names.\n3. Are any of these roles shared across multiple engagements? If so what is their availability percentage for this engagement?\n4. Are there any roles that will be filled by subcontractors or independent specialists?\n5. Are there any roles where the required seniority level needs to be adjusted?\n6. Are there any resource constraints I should be aware of? (e.g. specific individuals only available for part of the engagement, skills that are scarce, budget caps on seniority mix)\n7. What is the daily rate assumption for each seniority level? (This will be used in the budget — or type: To be confirmed)\n8. Are there any roles that are client-funded versus PwC-funded?\n9. Will any resources be working part-time on this engagement? If so what is their availability (e.g. 50% FTE)?\n10. Are there any onshore, offshore or near-shore resourcing considerations?\n11. Are there any visa, security clearance or background check requirements for any resources?\n12. Any other resource considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to assume based on standard engagement resourcing norms.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed roles, names, availability percentages and constraints\n- For any items where the user typed PROCEED or left blank apply standard PwC engagement resourcing assumptions\n- Flag any roles with no confirmed individual as TBC\n- Flag any workstreams where resource coverage appears insufficient given the effort estimates\n- Flag any resource conflicts where the same individual is assigned to overlapping tasks\n- Note all resourcing assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the Resource Plan as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Resource Plan as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the resource plan narrative, seniority mix analysis and resource strategy\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the full resource loading table, capacity plan, resource calendar, seniority mix tracker, cost summary and availability tracker applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).

resource role confirmed in Step 2\n- Set Confirmed to TBC for any role where no named individual was provided\n- Set Total Effort from the WBS effort estimates allocated to that role\n- Calculate FTE based on effort and engagement duration\n- Set Daily Rate to TBC if not confirmed\n- Set Total Cost to TBC if daily rate not confirmed\n\nFor Sheet 2 Resource Loading Table:\n- Distribute each resource's total effort across the weeks of their assignment period\n- Weight the effort distribution to reflect the schedule — heavier loading during peak delivery phases, lighter during initiation and close-out\n- Ensure the sum of weekly effort per resource equals their total effort from Sheet 1\n- Build the capacity row based on each resource's FTE and availability percentage\n\nFor Sheet 3 Capacity Plan:\n- Calculate total team capacity per week from Sheet 2\n- Calculate total demand per week from Sheet 2\n- Split demand by organisation type\n\nFor Sheet 7 Seniority Mix:\n- Populate from Sheet 1 data\n- Flag if Partner and Director percentage exceeds 30% of total effort as potentially high-cost\n- Flag if Associate and Analyst percentage is below 30% as potentially under-leveraged\n\nFor Sheet 8 Resource Risk Log:\n- Pre-populate with resource risks identified during the clarification process\n- Include at minimum: key person dependency risk, skill scarcity risk, client resource availability risk, third party delivery risk\n\n---\n\nNAMED RANGES\n\nCreate the following named ranges:\n- ResourceRegister: the full data table on Sheet 1\n- CriticalWorkstreams: a list of workstreams flagged as critical path in the WBS\n- HolidayList: public holidays from the Schedule workbook\n\n---\n\nWhere a field cannot be determined leave the cell blank and add a comment: 'To be confirmed.'\n\nEnsure all dropdown validations are applied and functional.\n\nEnsure all formulas are applied to all data rows and will extend correctly when new rows are added.\n\nEnsure the Resource Loading Table weekly columns are consistent with the Gantt chart week columns in the Schedule workbook.\n\nEnsure FTE calculations account for availability percentage (e.g. a resource at 50% availability working full-time on allocated tasks has an effective FTE of 0.5).\n\nEnsure utilisation calculations flag over-allocation clearly and that over-allocated weeks are visible at a glance on both Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.\n\nOnce both files are generated and available for download confirm you are ready to proceed to Step P2.5 RACI Matrix."
